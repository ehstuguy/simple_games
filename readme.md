# Purpose
The whole point of this repo is to follow up on Piracy Software's statement on just develpoing games if it interests you.
Suck at it, learn how to get better and try to make something you're proud of. I hate blogging, this is the closest thing
I'll have to a blog. I love games and want to learn how to develop them.
